The source of all [[Devils]] magic, from which the vessels for their souls are made, which give them form but allow for their identity to change and grow in a way they never could as [[Angels]]. It is the central point in the [[Marketplace of Masks]] and is constantly fed with souls to keep it burning. The [[Devils]] will protect it with their lives if need be, and so will [[Gregonto, Champion of the Void]] who is paid by them to do so, but who has their own motives too.
