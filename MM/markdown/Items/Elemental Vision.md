A token that grants a wielder elemental power, each associated with the [[Gnosis]] of the corresponding element's deity among the [[The Gods of the Flood|Gods of the Second Age]]

They are personal and nontransferable, they all radiate a moderate aura of conjuration. Each vision grants the wielder the ability to cast magic, and acts as a spellcasting focus, as well as a pair of specific powers of the associated element. 

Visions are almost exclusively granted to devout worshipers of a god, or to someone who embodies the virtues exalted by said god.

They can be revoked or destroyed. But if dispelled they are simply suppressed for the duration of the round.

| Element |  Damage   | Weakness  |
| ------- |:---------:|:---------:|
| Anemo   |  Thunder  |   Force   |
| Cryo    |   Cold    |   Fire    |
| Dendro  |  Poison   | Necrotic  |
| Electro | Lightning |   Acid    |
| Geo     |   Force   |  Thunder  |
| Hydro   |   Acid    | Lightning |
| Pyro    |   Fire    |   Cold    |

A Vision bearer, as they are commonly described, are resistant to the **Damage** associated with their **Element**, but they are also vulnerable to the one listed in the **Weakness** column. As such vision bearers of opposite elements don't tend to fight each other due to their extra damage being canceled out by the extra harm they suffer. The only ones being exempt from this dichotomy being Dendro wielders, whose element was incorporated later into [[Quintessence]] when [[L'zanes]] created the plane of Dendro. But they too tend to avoid the undead, for undead are often immune to poison and deal necrotic damage.


While using your vision as a spellcasting focus, you must choose an ability score to use as a spellcasting ability (SA).

Your Save DC = Proficiency + SA + 8.
Your Spell Attack = Proficiency + SA.

----
## Skill and Burst
When you gain the Vision you must choose the effects of your Skill and Burst. Collaborate with your DM to define them, the DM must agree to them.


The maximum damage/healing an Elemental Skill and Burst can cause are as detailed in the table below:

![[Elemental Skill & Burst table]]

As an Action you may choose to use either your Skill or Burst.
You can use your Skill a number of times equal to your (proficiency modifier + 1) per long rest.
You can use your Burst an amount of times per day equal to your (proficiency modifier-1). 
Once your proficiency modifier is high enough to have multiple charges per day:
> At the start of your turn you may roll 1d20 to attempt to recharge it, you must roll equal or less than your character level.
> If you fail to recharge it during the combat, it recharges once you are out of combat.

### Elemental Spells

Your Skill and Burst could potentially be an appropriate level spell, tweaked to deal elemental damage equal to the table above.

Your vision can be used as a Spellcasting focus for these spells. 
You know the chosen spells and they are always prepared, but do not count against your number of prepared spells per day. You may replace the spells chosen at a level up.
You may cast the cantrip at will, and each known 1st level or higher spell once per day.

You must choose an ability score to use as a spellcasting ability (SA).

Your Save DC = Proficiency + SA + 8.
Your Spell Attack = Proficiency + SA.

A character gains spells according to the following table:

| Character<br>Level | Cantrip | Spells | Max<br>Spell Level |
|:---------------:|:-------:|:------:| ---------------:|
|       1st       |    1    |   1    |             1st |
|       3rd       |    1    |   2    |             2nd | 
|       5th       |    2    |   2    |             3rd |
|       7th       |    2    |   3    |             4th |
|       9th       |    2    |   4    |             5th |

Below are some spells, sorted into the seven elements as themes, you could use them as is, or as a basis for a homebrew of a different element:

### Elemental Moves

If spellcasting isn't something you'd be interested, you can always try an alternative system, where the vision grants you special actions called moves.

##### Choose an elemental skill or roll a d6:
1.  Heal
2.  Gain temp hp
3.  Single attack as bonus action
4.  AOE damage or status condition
5.  Infuse element (Your character does Skill Dice elemental damage)
6.  Create an [[Elemental Construct]]

##### Choose an elemental burst or roll a d6:
1.  Heal
2.  Heal more than 1 creature
3.  Single attack as bonus action
4.  AOE damage or status condition
5.  Infuse element (Your character does Burst Dice elemental damage)
6.  Gain additional actions per turn or additional effect during a certain action


A creature that is hit with an Infuse Element move, retains that element for 2 rounds.

If another element is applied to the creature, that triggers an Elemental Reaction. The strength of the reaction depends on the level/CR of the creature that applied the second element. Reaction damage is always typed according to the triggering element.

![[Elemental Reaction Damage]]

#### Combination Reactions

##### Combustion (Pyro x Dendro)

If the triggering element is Dendro. The target takes reaction damage.
If the triggering element is Pyro. All creatures within a 5ft. radius take reaction damage and Dendro constructs in the area are destroyed.

Statuses are removed afterwards.

##### Overloaded (Pyro x Electro)

The creature suffers reaction damage. Any creature or object within a 5ft. radius takes only half of the rolled damage, rounded down.

Affected creatures must make a DC (5 + Damage) Dex Save, or be knocked prone. The size of the creature affects their roll, as per the following table.

![[Roll Modifier]]

For every 5 their roll is below the DC, the creature is knocked 5 ft. away from the overload target.

Statuses are removed afterwards.

##### Melt (Pyro x Cryo)

If the element that triggers melt is Pyro, the reaction damage is added to the average. If the element is Cryo, then the reaction damage is added to half the average.

Statuses are removed afterwards.

##### Electro-Charged (Hydro x Electro)

The creature and any creature affected by Hydro within a 5 ft. radius take half reaction damage. Targets within the radius can spread Electro-Charged further within a 5 ft. radius of themselves, if nearby creatures are also affected by Hydro, in which case they also take half reaction damage.

At the start of every turn the creature is affected by both Hydro and Electro, they take half reaction damage.

##### Frozen (Hydro x Cryo)

The creature must make a DC (5 + Damage/2) Str or Dex Save (their choice), or become incapacitated for a round. 
For every 5 points the creature fails the save by, they're incapacitated for an additional round (up to a maximum of 4). The size of the creature affects their roll as per the following table.

![[Roll Modifier]]

A creature frozen and incapacitated in this way becomes vulnerable to piercing/slashing damage. If the target takes more damage than the maximum reaction damage, they become unfrozen.

Statuses are removed afterwards.

##### Wilt (Cryo x Dendro)

Only Cryo itself can trigger this. The target takes half reaction damage. If the target is a [[Elemental Construct|Dendro construct]], or is affected by a Dendro buff, that effect's duration is reduced by 1 round.

The Cryo status is removed afterwards.

#### Support Reactions

##### Swirl (Anemo x Pyro/Hydro/Cryo/Electro/Dendro)

Only Anemo itself can trigger this. The target takes full reaction damage, while creatures/objects within a 10 ft. radius take half reaction damage. An exception to this is Hydro, which deals no reaction damage to any creatures but the target.

All creatures and objects affected have the corresponding element applied to them. If a creature has multiple statuses affecting them, such as from being frozen or Electro-charged, both elements deal swirl damage and spread both elements around.

##### Crystallize (Geo x Pyro/Hydro/Cryo/Electro)

Only Geo itself can trigger this. A crystal shard is dropped 5 ft. away from the target and towards the source of the reaction (or if the source an adjacent creature, the shield is directly applied to them.)

A creature that walks into the same space as the shard can choose to absorb the effects of the shield around them. 

The shield is temporary HP equal to the reaction damage, it stacks with other temporary HP (but not with other shields.)

A shield grants the shielded creature resistance to it's elemental damage type. 
Shards and shields last for only three rounds before fading away.

Statuses are removed from the target once the shard drops.

##### Bloom (Dendro x Hydro)

Only a healing move can trigger this. If the Dendro/Hydro move used would cause healing, the creature regains the HP and any HP that exceeds their HP maximum is converted to temporary HP. 

This temporary HP can only stack with the Crystallize's temp HP.

Statuses are removed afterwards

##### Undermine (Dendro x Geo)

Only Dendro itself can trigger this. The target takes reaction damage. If the target is a [[Elemental Construct|Geo construct]] or has a Crystallize shield. That effect's duration is reduced by 1 round.

Statuses are removed afterwards.
