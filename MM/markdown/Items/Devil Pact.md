The act of summoning a [[Devils|devil]] requires the summoner to enter a pact with it, if the devil agrees to it then the summoner receives a [[Devil's Kiss]] until the conditions of both parties are fulfilled.


All [[Devils]] are able to make [[Devil Pact|pacts]] with mortals, a process in which a devil is summoned forth from the [[Void Between the Stars|Void]] and offered a bargain. If they accept then the creature is marked with a [[Devil's Kiss]] and both parties must fulfill their side of the bargain, the devil gains through the kiss a small portion of the creature's soul which it can use to further it's own goals and if the creature doesn't fulfill their end of the bargain, the devil can claim the whole soul for themselves.

[[Devils]] aim to have as many kisses upon mortals as they can, for even if the mortal fulfills the bargain, they retain the soul fragments which can be traded or fed to [[The Black Flame]]

The pact is made once both sides verbalize the agreement. 

A devil will go to great lengths to fulfill its side of the bargain, for [[Devils]] are beings kept coherent by will and magic, and as such their promises are entwined into their very being. Therefore [[Devils]] don't make pacts unless they believe they can fulfill them or cause the other party to fail first. 

If a pact is no longer beneficial to them, they may choose to break it through a gruesome process, wherein they must relinquish not only the promise, but the identity they held when making it. 

This is a loophole inherent in all pacts, because - technically - a devil who doesn't exist anymore can't be indebted to a mortal summoner.

To do so, the devil sheds all their names and their mask, becoming a formless creature of unbound and ravenous [[The Black Flame| black flame]]. This is usually a last ditch effort, upon which the devil either needs to consume the flame-kissed mortal, regaining their magic. Or be bound again with a new name and mask, a process few sorcerers have ever managed to complete without being completely incinerated by the Black Flame.
