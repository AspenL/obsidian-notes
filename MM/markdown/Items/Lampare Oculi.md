#### Description

> This amber red amulet in the shape of an open eye is made of fulgurite and blackened bone. The twine that holds it is woven from sinew, but is surprisingly warm to the touch and pliable despite it's dryness.
> 
> The amulet was once worn as a symbol of power among a religious sect of spell-casters during the Nishil Interregnum in Suthelia. Very few of these remain.

The wearer of the amulet can cast Lightning Lure at will.

While wearing the amulet, an attuned creature is **resistant to lightning** damage and can **understand Celestial**.  
  
As a **Bonus Action**, the attuned wearer may spend a Hit Dice to gain a Fly speed of 30 ft for one minute.  
At the end of the bearer's turn if they are not in contact with the ground they take 2d8 radiant damage. This damage cannot be negated or reduced.

On your turn you speak a command work, causing the amulet to flash brightly.
All creatures within 20 ft, including yourself, must succeed on a Con save or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature may use its action to rub their eyes and attempt the save again.

You gain disadvantage on saving throws against blindness and visual effects such as gaze attacks.
