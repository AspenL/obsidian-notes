A mark of a [[Devil Pact]], which presents itself as a burning ember on the body of the summoner, a parasitic piece of [[The Black Flame]] binding the soul of the summoner to the soul of the summoned. 

A devil's kiss grants the bearer with immunity to the correspondent devil, as well as a means by which to cast magic. It serves as a seal of the contract made. 


While bearing a Devil's Kiss, a creature gains a spell slot of a level lower than their proficiency modifier. This spell slot can only be used to cast warlock spells.

At the end of a long rest the creature can choose a warlock spell of a level lower than their proficiency modifier, they know that spell and can cast it with the aforementioned slot. If the creature chooses a different spell at the end of the long rest, it replaces the one before it.

While bearing the Devil's Kiss the creature cannot be harmed by the devil they entered the pact with, in addition the devil can use an action to *teleport* to the creature, the demon always knows their exact location.
