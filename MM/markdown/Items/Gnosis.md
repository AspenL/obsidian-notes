A gnosis is a shard of divinity, granted from [Aster] to a creature that has proven themselves worthy of ascending to godhood through the two trials:
The first being the trial of faith, where they accrue a large group of followers who truly believe in their ideals and power.
The second being the trial of proof, where they solidify said belief through the working of a miracle, using up the magic bestowed upon them by their followers.

This discharge of emotion calls the attention of Aster who bestows upon them a shard from it's own life, as it was commanded to do by it's creator at the dawn of the universe.

The shard is malleable and while it is to be used by the new god, it is a catalyst and a focus of the shared faith put into them by their followers. As such the powers it contains are whatever the collective worshipers believe their god's powers are.

And this poses a very threatening conundrum to the god, because if they show weakness, their power dwindles; if the worshipers abandon their god, the gnosis loses it's power; and if their followers interpret their actions erroneously, their powers change to reflect the new view of the god. 

So if the people were to discover that the gods are fallible, and that their divinity was given to them and thus something attainable, surely the mortals would revolt and seek that power for themselves. As such, whenever a mortal starts accruing too many followers the gods quickly jump to make them propositions of heroics so that they may attach their name to the hero's and divert the worship onto themselves, hopefully leading the hero to martyrdom or disgrace so that they don't rise as well and tip the power balance between the gods.
