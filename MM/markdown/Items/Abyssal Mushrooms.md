#### Effects 

A creature that approaches within 15 ft of a cluster is subject to the spores and must succeed a DC 15 Charisma save or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed the creature regards any fungi or plant as interesting, harmless or even friendly. The creature may attempt the save again if it suffers damage, ending the effect on itself with a success. 

A creature that eats the mushroom or its byproducts must succeed a DC 20 Charisma save or be charmed.
While charmed the creature has a compulsion to feed the mushrooms, by giving it meat or planting it into a source of meat it knows of. The charm ends once a creature reaches 0 HP. The creature may attempt the save again every time it feeds the colony.
## Lore
#### Description
These softly luminescent mushrooms range in size, growing up to 3 ft in height and 10 inches wide. 
	Their fruiting bodies have long eccentric clavate stipes growing decurrent and broad lamellae in forking uplifted margins and silky glutinous pilleus of an umbonate shape when young that turns to depressed as they age. Their caps are powder blue with bone-white stems and Prussian blue gills and black spores.
	Their spongy flesh and plentiful black latex have a sweet earthy scent and flavor.

In layman's terms, these mushrooms are light blue with white stalks and dark blue gills peeking out, their surface is leathery and slimy, the small ones are bell shaped and the large ones are bowl shaped. There is little variation in color and the stems are thicker at the soil, they bleed black and smell good.

Their blue glow is flickering and comes from the surface of the caps, it does not stop once plucked. 
#### Origin
The [[Abyss|Abyssal]] Mushrooms come from Zuggtmoy's domain in [[Abyss|Umeo]], being adapted to terrestrial and aquatic environments. They require shade and moisture. They are carnivorous, they do not rot.
