[[Faelloc]]'s domain among the planes. 

The place where all souls come to rest and seek atonement


With the flood that ended the first world came the death of nearly all mortals. These deceased crowded the afterlife seeking their just rewards/punishments and the judgement of the gods. This caused a great imbalance upon Pharasma's Ossuarry

Worsened by the fact that for centuries the goddess had no worshippers to keep her powers, weakening the borders of the boneyard and allowing uncounted spirits to flee.

Those stray spirits roamed the [[Void Between the Stars|Void]] for a subjective eternity, until their souls were unraveled to dust. And in this land of eternal winter, built upon the remains of these stray souls, sits [[Faelloc]] in her marble throne presiding over the dead.
Endless festivals are held for the penitent souls, sometimes culminating in a soul being uplifted to their god's realm in the [[Twin Paradises]].
As for the tainted souls, [[Faelloc]] holds court at the Coliseum, conscripting them in blood-sports and tossing the unsuccessful down into [[Abyss|The Abyss]]
