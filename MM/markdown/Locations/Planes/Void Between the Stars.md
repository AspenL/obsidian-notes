One of the planes of existance

Beyond the walls of [[Amalgam]] and the plains that surround it, therein lies an infinity of empty and cold space, punctuated by stray stars drifting ever away from sight.

In this land that isn't and cannot be, among the littered corpses of foul monsters and the husks of long dead gods sat upon their dilapidated kingdoms there are yet creatures that strive for an existence freed from divine influences.

The [[Gith]] travel the vacuum in their galleys, sailing the psychic winds, dancing with their oversized blades forged from the magical ore of dead leviathan scales. Building unkowable mechanisms or waging wars for abstract resources among their kin.
It may seem futile to any mortal unlucky enough to meet them, but the Gith provide a vital service for creation, they maintain the abominations borne of terrors of the void, protecting - involuntarily - all life from complete anihilation.
