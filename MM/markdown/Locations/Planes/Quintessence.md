One of The Planes of Existence

Home to the [[Elementals]], a group of creatures composed of a single magical energy or material substance, such as: Earth, Water, Fire, etc.

In the center of creation lies a world of pure magic and power, where the pains and mountains extend endlessly. Divided evenly between the 7 elements that form the [[Material Plane]] and their combinations where one touches the other.

In the center where the 7 mingle lies the greatest city that was or will be, [[Amalgam]].

Amalgam is the capital of Quintessence, ruled in the ground by a council of ancient djinn and in the sky by the gods in their domains at the [[Twin Paradises]].
