The Abyss is a rift that was created by [[Azion]] during an argument with [[Ondir]], where the god of lightning attacked the ocean god with his whip, making a large fissure on the seafloor.

As such the Abyss is physically accessible from the material plane.
In the middle of the ocean there is a point where the sea level steadily drops until you are surrounded by water but walking on dry rock, with tidepools and rapids that flow into the fissure from which wild magic spews forth.

Should one survive long enough to reach the fissure, they will find themselves falling from impossibly high into the first layer of the Abyss.

### The Layers

The abyss is seemingly infinite although it is divided into layers, with the shallower ones being where the weakest [[Demons]] live, and the less sinful souls end up; the deepest ones having the strongest [[Demons]] and where the worst sinners are cast down onto (be it due to the weight of their sins dragging them down, the force with which [[Faelloc]]'s servants toss them, or just that the lesser [[Demons]] are not permitted to touch them is uncertain)

The abyss is divided into five layers, the further down, the stronger is the old magic that sustains it. They are from the most superficial to the deepest: 

[[Umeo]] (wet)
The layer composed of ocean water, which spews endlessly from a tear in reality into a geiser a thousand miles high, flooding a veritable ocean in this, the lowest layer of the Abyss.
In Umeo the demons are usually aquatic, living in a constant feeding frenzy, eating anything that is unlucky enough to pass through into the infested waters, and sometimes even devouring each other.
They are both the deterrent against invaders as well as cannon fodder when an incursion happens, if the frigid waters don’t take care of them first that is.

[[Muriat]] (salty)
The layer composed of dry dunes of salt, the natural consequence for surrounding an eternal ocean in the vacuum. A vast extense of not only desertic landscape, but one that drains any travelers of even their last drop of liquid, be it blood or sweat.
The demons of Muriat are vicious and bloodthirsty. They travel in small groups for protection against stronger ones. Territorial fights are common, specially among those near the water of Umeo.
Organic creatures are specially prized in Muriat, for a devil can drain moisture from them just by proximity.

[[Assula]] (cracked)
The layer composed of dry carcasses and bones, either falling from the sky spewed out from Umeo by the geiser, or the remains of the unfortunate who braved Muriat only to perish at the edge of it. The stench of death permeates the area and the minds of those who find themselves in it.
The demons of Assula are used to the toxic gas and poisonous sludge that drips from the carcassess and from some of their kin. They are keen on growing their own piles of trophies and will hunt down any who pass through their land.
They distill some of the most potent poisons in the planescape, as they need to have an edge over the other demons in Assula if they try to steal from their trophies.
These demons are hardy and stealthy, they can’t be noticed before the ambush or they risk attracting unwanted attention from bigger foes.

[[Lampare]] (shining)
The layer composed of flashing magical energy, left over from the blow dealt by Azion against Ondir. Ricocheting and sparking against the air.
As a consequence of their unpredictable enviroment, the demons of Lampare are incredibly fast and adept at redirecting magical energy. They are some of the most likely to be mistaken by angels, given their often luminous appearance and exhilarating personality.
They are the elite soldiers of the demonic hordes, striking fast and being out of reach before the enemy can react. Be it slinging spells or absorbing them they are masters of magic.

[[Kyeh]] (dark)
The layer composed of empty space and mirages, infused with the darker aspects of [[Azion|Azion's]] magic. Causing fear and despair to those who traverse it.
The demons of Kyeh are masters of disguise and illusion, camouflaging themselves to strike opportunistic blows upon their prey.
