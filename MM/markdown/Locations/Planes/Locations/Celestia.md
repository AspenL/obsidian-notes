Celestia is [[Celandine]]'s domain within the [[Twin Paradises]].

Those souls who emerge victorious from [[Faelloc]]'s games are claimed by one of the gods and taken to Celestia, where their bodies are rebuilt from pure magic to serve as messengers and guardians for said god. Each angel is molded by one deity and that is to whom they are subject, but all angels are brethren and part of the [[Celestial Hordes]].

It is primarily a training grounds for the soldiers of the gods in the [[Celestial Hordes]], but it is also their homeland and as such there are places of industry, contemplation and respite for the angels. Physically it is a grandiose and ample pavilion of white stone surrounded by fields of Red Celandines. [[Celandine]] oversees the hordes and their training within the realm but the angels are in service only to their creator deity.


The pious souls who are uplifted by Celandine may also join the hordes, usually doing so in positions handpicked to their strong suits instead of as rank and file soldiers.
