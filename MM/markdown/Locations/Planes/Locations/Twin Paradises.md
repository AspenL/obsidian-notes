Above [[Amalgam]] there's a ring of floating islands, each one inhabited by a God and formed to their preference. Even [[Ondir]] who prefers to roam the seas has a beach where he keeps his greatest treasures. It is said that the mortals chosen as champions in [[Faelloc]]'s festivals are taken by their respective gods to their islands to bask in their power and glory.

Although when seen from Amalgam, the ring may appear not much larger than the city's outer ring, each island is its own world, as large as the governing god desires. Be it [[Dedros]]' workshop, where they build cathedrals and pyramids endlessly to push the bounds of architecture and awe their followers; or the hall of [[Teancri]] where a thousand rooms fill themselves with the scent of infinite fragrances of incense and tobacco.

The crossing from one island to another is made in the backs of a gigantic creature called [[Bâ€™Dooga]], a celestial being with a long fuzzy body of soft white fur, and a massive grin of human teeth, along with a pair of beady eyes, black like the [[Void Between the Stars|Void]]. The B'Dooga encircle the islands, flying in their flocks to form the ring in between the islands.
