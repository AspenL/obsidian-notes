An island that fell apart away from [[Quintessence]] and now floats lost in the [[Void Between the Stars]], home to the [[Devils]] and their main operation base. The island is kept from completely freezing over in the void due to the [[Devils]]' constant feeding of [[The Black Flame]].


The marketplace is a chaotic bundle of stonecarved shops, stands, alcoves, bars, nooks and crannies where [[Devils]] of all colors lurk and mingle. The main currency on the marketplace is souls, but bartering is quite common. It is all governed by 
the Primordial Dragon [[Gregonto, Champion of the Void]]
