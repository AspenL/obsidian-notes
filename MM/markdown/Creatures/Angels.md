The servants of [[The Gods of the Flood|The New Gods]], members of the [[Celestial Hordes|Celestial Horde]]. A given angelic battalion is identical in shape, although originally being different souls from mortal creatures, the angel's training under [[Celandine]]'s watchful gaze smooths out the irregularities and individuality they once possessed, turning them into carbon copies of each other. 

This doesn't mean all angels are the same, that could not be further from the truth. A battalion of angels are simply made from the same mold. But between different battalions angels will take the most varied of shapes and builds to serve their creator's ideals and purposes.

As such, a group of guide angels under [[Thanagolth]] and one under [[Xybus]] will be completely different, despite serving the same purpose. As such, followers of a particular deity gain advantage on Religion rolls to identify angels from their deity.
