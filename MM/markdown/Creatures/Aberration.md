Aberrations are creatures who don't subscribe to the concept of 'life' in some fundamental form on the inhabited planes. They are beings who should not be alive but nevertheless are. They tend to come from the deep recesses of The [[Void Between the Stars|Void-Between]], creatures such as the [[Mindflayer]] and their horrid experiments.
