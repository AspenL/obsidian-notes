The beings made of pure energy or a single type of matter, eternal in that they often require no breath, food, drink or sleep. But also the most mortal in that if killed in their homeland in [[MM/markdown/Locations/Planes/Quintessence]] (meaning outside the city of [[Amalgam]] or one of the other elemental planes) they have no soul and won't be taken to an afterlife.
