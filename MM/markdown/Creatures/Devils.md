Devils are creatures whose origin is uncertain, they are what happens when an angel is defeated or cast down by their god, and left to die in the [[Void Between the Stars]] where they eventually are taken to the [[Marketplace of Masks]].

A defeated angel is cut off from their god's power, and thus loses their body of magic. The devils in the marketplace forge them a new body from [[The Black Flame]] out of pure magic, so that they may retain a semblance of life.
They are given a mask to focus and bind their soul to the new vessel.

The flame is a mutable thing and thus a devil's power and form are subject to it's identity, the more recognizable and solid their id, the greater their power , the inverse also applies, the less well known or nebulous they are the meeker their body and power will be.

So a devil's name is a thing of great importance in it's life. When masked they are given an overly complex name, as to remember their life as an angel where they were but another soldier in a legion of often identical ones.

As they mature, devils will cast out parts of said name and grow in power, passing through the six stages of devilry, which are in least to greatest order:

1. White Devil
2. Blue Devil
3. Purple Devil
4. Red Devil
5. Green Devil
6. Gold Devil

Some are able to achieve such renown as to become a wholly new creature, a devil of legend such as Baator or Demogorgon. Reaching then the 7th stage:

7. Black Devil

They must be careful not to fall complacent though, as spreading their power too thin can cause them to revert to an earlier state in the ranks.


All devils are able to make [[Devil Pact|pacts]] with mortals, a process in which a devil is summoned forth from the [[Void Between the Stars|Void]] and offered a bargain. If they accept then the creature is marked with a [[Devil's Kiss]] and both parties must fulfill their side of the bargain, the devil gains through the kiss a small portion of the creature's soul which it can use to further it's own goals and if the creature doesn't fulfill their end of the bargain, the devil can claim the whole soul for themselves.

Devils aim to have as many kisses upon mortals as they can, for even if the mortal fulfills the bargain, they retain the soul fragments which can be traded or fed to [[The Black Flame]]
