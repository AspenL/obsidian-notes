As far as anyone can tell demons were not created, rather they were a mishap of divinity.

During the fight that created [[Abyss]] the trench in the sea was left for all manner of sea-life to fall into, these things were drenched in magic and left to rot in the most chaotic and inhospitable environments the multiverse had to offer. Demons are inadvertently one of evolution's greatest triumphs.

They, as far as anyone has been able to ascertain, simply started existing one day. 

They are a petty, squabbling and ravenous bunch of wretched and horrid creatures.

Fed by the mangled and mutated remains of the souls that fail the arena of [[Faelloc]] and are tossed down from the heavens into the pit of [[Abyss]].

Their insatiable hunger for souls leads them to prod out of the deep recesses of the sea floor and into the [[Material Plane]] to extricate the souls from their still living flesh.

Their hunger is only stopped, weirdly by [[Devils]], who use souls as a bartering coin and require a constant influx of them to keep their life giving flame lit. And as such kill Demons and tempt mortals so that their souls will be cast down for them to grab on the way out.
