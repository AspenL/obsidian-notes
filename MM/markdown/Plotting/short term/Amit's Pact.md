Barbarian Path

Path of the Emerald Mantis

Dreams of Electric Shepherds

You are imparted with esoteric knowledge and cryptic broken prophecies.
You gain proficiency in two of your choice:
	a) Two exotic weapons or two sets of tools
	b) Arcana or Artificing
	c) Stealth or Acrobatics
	d) One exotic language

You can cast the *Augury* spell once per long rest, receiving a vision in a dream.

Lifespark Conduit

Your connection to a supernatural entity from the void bolsters your skill in detecting foes and striking where most effective.
While you are raging you gain blindsight to a range of 15 ft, which extends into the ethereal plane.


Cumulus Charge

You can choose at the end of a long rest to channel the eldritch powers of the entity.
If so you gain resistance to lightning damage and a fly speed of 30 ft until the start of your next long rest. You become vulnerable to acid and fall damage while in this state.
