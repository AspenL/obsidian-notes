## Description 

### Ptepmenib
Ptepmenib through his investigations and roaming in the necropolis made allies with some dark folk, the caligni. The clan of Xotl is living in an abandoned manor not far from the house of Pentheru. Ptepmenib will provide a letter in undercommon to give to them and they may be of some assistance at the very least with information.

The church turns a blind eye to them as their adoration of tombs and burial practices discourages them from desecrating the dead and they tend to deal with the undead on their own too.

Ptepmenib will "pray that Faelloc keeps an eye on you" implying Qassin will be close by

The Xotl leader is a woman by the name of unwrapped harmony

### Sebti
Sebti will swear [[Z.E.F. - The Zombie Extermination Force|the party]] to secrecy before telling them about the compasses
These complex magical-clockwork devices were the OG purpose of [[Voices of the Pack|The Voice]], and they serve to locate strong sources of necromancy.
They point in a straight line so it is likely one may need to use three or more to pinpoint a source.
But doubtlessly the strongest necromancy will be the artifact
The compasses are 18 centuries old and most have broken down, but last they were used, some 40 years ago there were 5 still active.

They are delicate and not to be moved, but easy to use. She'll give them a rough copy of the map

Sebti will also say that they have found no leadership or any thugs in the brickworks, but there was a collapsed tunnel so the party should expect to have company in the necropolis.
### Nakht
Suspects the cult of lamias called the Amushet to be behind the undead, they must have seen an opportunity to strike against [[Faelloc]] and her followers with the lottery, or having been angered by it.
Nakht believes the lamia know bizarre magics and are known for taking paramours/sex slaves from among the populace, which they only let go after driving them insane and blinding them.
Nakht knows that they are 3 lamia, plus whatever they may have gathered and they live in the Cenotaph of the Cynic, which used to be a monument in honor of those who passed in a plague, but was converted into a grave for the atheistic dead who required less space for iconography.

There was a member of the city guard who went missing, before the sanctum was assigned, during the explorations and Nakht suspects the lamia took him.


Nakht will still sustain that they have not much time, before the week's end the voice may not have the numbers necessary to keep watch over the wall, and all will be lost.
He can give the party 4 days at most, but if at the dusk of the 3rd things are dire his hand may be forced.
