## Description 

The party will explore the sewers

The sewers are taken over by both undead and fungi, fighting a turf war of sorts
On the center of the larger basin/cave there is a pipe with boiling water, growing around it is an assassin vine who likes the heat
The offal of it is what feeds the fungi and the vegepygmies

The otyugh is in actuality mainly jealous that he doesnt get to eat the zombies and occasional adventurers


The ottyugh wants to destroy the community of the Vegepygmies, he aims to use the party in doing so.
He asks that they take out a thing that is keeping their habitat proper for them, so that they will wilt in time and he can take the turf over. The party is not informed of this, only of what to do.

He asks that the party go and repair or fiddle with certain parts of the tubes, in order to raise the salinity/acidity and kill off the moldies.
He was slighted by the Polevik and they are in a slow war of attrition.

The sewer layout is:
			Room - Room \
Entrance <                                  end
			Room - Room /
