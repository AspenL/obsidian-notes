Should the players die in the next battle here is a blurb:



As you fall, you feel wheightlessless, barely registering that you've hit the ground. The sounds are muffled by the thrum of your heartbeat, drumming its desperate song still. 
The color drains and washes away, as the waters of the great river do when the flood passes. And with it so does the pain, your body is soft and weightless. As the Ka untangles from the flesh, your Khet breathing your last breath.
Wind rustling the feathers of your Ba bird, reminding you of the way home, of the open desert.
The familiar weight of your Ib within your chest, still tethers you to this world. You know that soon Anubis will weigh it on the scales.

You raise and see around you, the spirits of your companions. The world is dim and gray, wispy and malleable, the only color cast on it being the golden light of your souls.
And watching over you, as a hen nesting her chicks, is one single whippoorwill.
