### Prayers 
"We pray to you our lord in darkness, we praise your might and the flash of your divine wrath upon those who stand against us.

We bare our fangs in fear, that you may grant us the gift of light among the endless expanse of the dark night.

We bare our claws in supplication, that you may strike down the foes we cannot cut ourselves.

We howl into the night, that you may see our offerings worthy and our hearts true.

We pray in revelry, we pray in ecstasy, at the sight of your glory!

May the storm wash away our sins, and drown our enemies' cries in divine lightning."

- The Howl of Thunder

Drink our sins, drink our fears!

Take our fallen as they bleed

On your blazing battlefield!"

## Dedros
### Holy Text
Whose holy text is the [[Builder's Grand Design]], a codex of carved tablets inscribed with both geometric and mathematical patterns, with chants and psalms in the whitespaces. The followers believe it to be a blueprint to a grand project, but none have puzzled it yet. Rumored missing pages are forged, stolen and unearthed often, some faithful believe the design to be purposefully incomplete as a moral lesson.
### Prayers 

"Cold, the air and wind flowing.

Hard, the land we call our home.

Push, to keep the dark from coming.

Feel the weight of what we grow.

This, the song of sons and daughters.

Carved, in the heart of who we are.

Strong, united, working lest we fall."

- The Song of Winter

## Faelloc
### Holy Text
Whose holy text is the [[Ashen Flow]], a collection of tales and parables, all relating to lessons of patience, virtuousness and the balance between life and death. Ranging from the mundane to the incomprehensible. No one is sure of the order they should be bound in, as some relate ancient pre-history while some seem prophesizing the far future. As such the tomes are made to be easily re-bound.
### Prayers 
"Oh white wolf who roams the desert,

Take pity on our souls.

Take heart of our toil,

Spare us one winter more.

Let us see our kin again come fall.

When the hourglass is empty,

When our sand has joined the desert's ash,

Take our souls then.

We pray that day is far away."

- Plea of the Hourglass

## Kyborh
### Holy Text
Whose holy text is the [[Stringed Sermons]], a woven tapestry of wisdom and charades, often told in song when recited during his services. The written versions are made to reveal musical notations from the exacting instructions when read upside down.
### Prayers 
"I stand before the edge,

Upon your web I lay my pledge.

I seek to hear the chord,

I lift my voice, I bring no sword.

I seek for wisdom or a sign,

Pray your many eyes see more than mine.

I bring you songs upon your shrine,

Weave me a silken fate oh great divine."
- The Offering at the Web.

## L'zanes
### Holy Text
Whose holy text is the [[Cleanse in Deluge]], a tome of archaic language detailing expurgations, tithes and rites of purification to be carried out in specific conditions by her faithful.

The tomes must only be written by a follower during rain, in purple ink or other medium.
### Prayers 
"Your shadow over the sun,

Your holy rain's flow has begun.

It washes our weariness,

It carries our desires.

Free our thoughts high in the sky,

Lend us amethyst wings to fly.

Bring us your flood,

Silt is in our blood."
- Hymnal of Deluge

## Naros

### Prayers 
"Place your hand to guide,
mold me onto a scribe.

Ink and quill to heart,
chisel in stone my art.

Bring me at your side,
by land or tide.

My people take pride,
Our name heard far and wide.
"
- The Bard's Canticle

## Ondir
### Holy Text
Whose holy text is the [[Law from the Driftwood]], a dozen tablets of driftwood written in mother-of-pearl, found all over the world after historic storms.

### Holy Text
Whose holy text is the [[Dreaming Scrawl]], a tome of prophecies and portents as well as obscure methods for soothsaying.

## Teancri
### Holy Text
Whose holy text is the [[Treatise of Trade and Leisure]], a tome of incredibly esoteric economical theory, precepts and advice.

## Thanagolth
### Holy Text
Whose holy text is the [[Tome of Hidden Light]], a tome of incisive and ardent philosophy on magic, specifically arcane and occult. Dealing with the practice of the known, the pursuit of innovation and the refining of the supposedly perfected. Spurring the practitioner into an ever growing impetus for greater and more precise feats of thaumaturgy in search of a singular truth at the core of existence. The tome is initially unchallenging but becomes increasingly labyrinthine as it progresses.
Most wizards are familiar with the beginnings of it, which is used as elementary reading for students.

### Unholy Text
Whose unholy text is the [[Rotten Depravity of Righteousness]], a tome of poetry denouncing the evils of truth, love, trust and nobility.

Leading the reader towards the understanding that in truth all base animalistic and sinful instincts are natural and more virtuous than taming oneself for the benefit of charlatans.

# Others
## Nyarlathotep
### Unholy Text
Whose unholy text is dependent on which facet is being worshipped, but often talks of attaining power through increasingly dangerous and perverse rituals, of summoning strength and knowledge from the banished unholiness that crawls and hungers in the void, of unmaking and corrupting your enemies and the very foundations of all they hold sacred. Promising eternal power, richness and status beyond ones feeble mortal understanding.
