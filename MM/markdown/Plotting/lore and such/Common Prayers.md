### Azion

"We pray to you our lord in darkness, we praise your might and the flash of your divine wrath upon those who stand against us.

We bare our fangs in fear, that you may grant us the gift of light among the endless expanse of the dark night.

We bare our claws in supplication, that you may strike down the foes we cannot cut ourselves.

We howl into the night, that you may see our offerings worthy and our hearts true.

We pray in revelry, we pray in ecstasy, at the sight of your glory!

May the storm wash away our sins, and drown our enemies' cries in divine lightning."

- The Howl of Thunder

### Celandine

"Bright flame on the battlefield, burn!

In our hearts, in our nights, burn!

Bloody flower 'neath our feet

Drink our sins, drink our fears!

Take our fallen as they bleed

On your blazing battlefield!"

- The Marching Hosana

### Dedros

"Cold, the air and wind flowing.

Hard, the land we call our home.

Push, to keep the dark from coming.

Feel the weight of what we grow.

This, the song of sons and daughters.

Carved, in the heart of who we are.

Strong, united, working lest we fall."

- The Song of Winter

### Faelloc
"Oh white wolf who roams the desert,

Take pity on our souls.

Take heart of our toil,

Spare us one winter more.

Let us see our kin again come fall.

When the hourglass is empty,

When our sand has joined the desert's ash,

Take our souls then.

We pray that day is far away."

- Plea of the Hourglass

### Kyborh
"I stand before the edge,

Upon your web I lay my pledge.

I seek to hear the chord,

I lift my voice, I bring no sword.

I seek for wisdom or a sign,

Pray your many eyes see more than mine.

I bring you songs upon your shrine,

Weave me a silken fate oh great divine."
- The Offering at the Web.

### L'zanes
"Your shadow over the sun,

Your holy rain's flow has begun.

It washes our weariness,

It carries our desires.

Free our thoughts high in the sky,

Lend us amethyst wings to fly.

Bring us your flood,

Silt is in our blood."
- Hymnal of Deluge

### Naros
"Place your hand to guide,
mold me onto a scribe.

Ink and quill to heart,
chisel in stone my art.

Bring me at your side,
by land or tide.

My people take pride,
Our name heard far and wide.

Isto é algo que se revelou válido milhares de vezes"
