Amit has touched Kida's Gemstone, he will be affected by the <i>Dream</i> spell.

Amit is in his childhood home. The village outside is dark and indistinct

There is a sandstorm in the sky, stars sparking like firecrackers as it moves, creeping closer and closer.

The house is empty.

All houses are empty.
There are tracks of people being dragged away.
Toward the horizon is a flame, spiraling and rising high, shadows dancing around it.
The smoke against the night sky forms the shape of a gnoll eating a child.

There is a scream, Amit recognizes it as Anat.
A rain of flaming arrows are fired at the village.

Followed by a peel of lightning from the storm.
There is a glowing sword in the sandstone nearby.

If taken Amit talks to Kida.

Emerald Tutor

You are imparted with esoteric knowledge and cryptic riddles.
You gain proficiency in two of your choice:
	a) Two exotic weapons
	b) Arcana or Artificing
	c) Stealth or Intimidation
	d) One exotic language

Lightning Claws

During your turn you may spend a round of rage to gain resistance to lightning damage for 1 minute.  Your weapon attacks deal an additional +2 lightning damage for the duration.

Lifespark Conduit

Your connection to a supernatural entity from the void bolsters your skill in detecting foes and striking where most effective.
While you are raging you gain blindsight to a range of 15 ft, which extends into the ethereal plane.
Your weapon attacks are considered magical if the target is within your blindsight.

Cumulus Charge

You can use an action to channel the eldritch powers of the entity.
While channeling you gain immunity to lightning damage and a fly speed of 30 ft (no hover).
You become vulnerable to acid and fall damage while in this state. 
This effect lasts up to a number of rounds equal to your level, but can be dismissed at the end of your turn. 
All spent rounds are regained after a long rest.
This action sustains rage as if it were an attack.


Mirage Mantis

Your reflexes are bolstered by the surges of electricity flowing through your nerves, flashing brightly in your defense.
Your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity while raging. 
Hostile creatures that start their turn within your blindsight take 2d12 lightning damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.
