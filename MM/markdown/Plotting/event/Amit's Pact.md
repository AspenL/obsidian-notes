Amit has touched Kida's Gemstone, he will be affected by the <i>Dream</i> spell.

Amit is in his childhood home. 
### Option A
```
You ride in to the village
Your first solo ride, freshly turned thirteen not long ago
Turban covering your ears and a scarf over your face
Protecting you from the sun and wind

As you crest the dune you are caught in wind
A sandstorm blows through the village
Streets are empty and tossed as curtains whip about

You can navigate to your home, same as it ever was
[What did your childhood home look like Amit?]

Same as it ever was, except...
The door is ajar, the candles have blown out
The window shutters bang against the walls
Wind rages outside
It is the middle of the day and the world
is dark with sand and dust


[You hear the sound of drums and shrills]

Through the breaks in the sand you can see
There is no light in the other houses
Their doors just as ajar

[What do you do Amit?]

The house has signs of a struggle
The pottery cracked on the floor
Slash marks on the wall
A pillow torn open as is the carpet under it

Blood, still fresh and dripping

You hear cackles and laughter
Some foreign tongue
A crack and another and another
Reverberating with a tinitus ring in your ears

[You hear a scream from outside]

It is a woman's voice
A pained guttural shout in anguish
It is your mother's

[Amit? What was your father's name?]

She cries out to him

[You are unarmed. Where is your father's weapon?]

The sheath/scabbard/bag is empty
You hear Anat crying
Everything freezes into darkness

[What emotion do you feel right now Amit?]

Everything is green.

You are shackled to the walls, straining to move

A Voice asks.
"Would you have had the strenght?"
"If the weapon was there?"

"Let your instinct take over, let the fury run amok, let the lightning flow in your veins"
"Let the power flow through the shackles to you"

"I lie chained and yet I offer a hand, will you take it?"
```
### Option B
```
The village outside is dark and indistinct

The house is empty.

All houses are empty.

There is a sandstorm in the sky, stars sparking like firecrackers as it moves, creeping closer and closer.

There are tracks of people being dragged away.
Atop a dune toward the horizon is a flame, spiraling and rising high, shadows dancing around it.
The smoke against the night sky forms the shape of a gnoll eating a child.

There is a scream, Amit recognizes it as Anat.
A rain of flaming arrows are fired at the village.

Followed by a peel of lightning from the storm.
There is a glowing sword in the sandstone nearby.

If taken Amit talks to Kida.

Emerald Tutor

You are imparted with esoteric knowledge and cryptic riddles.
You gain proficiency in two of your choice:
	a) Two exotic weapons
	b) Arcana or Artificing
	c) Stealth or Intimidation
	d) One exotic language

Lightning Claws

During your turn you may spend a round of rage to gain resistance to lightning damage for 1 minute.  Your weapon attacks deal an additional +2 lightning damage for the duration.

Lifespark Conduit

Your connection to a supernatural entity from the void bolsters your skill in detecting foes and striking where most effective.
While you are raging you gain blindsight to a range of 15 ft, which extends into the ethereal plane.
Your weapon attacks are considered magical if the target is within your blindsight.

Cumulus Charge

You can use an action to channel the eldritch powers of the entity.
While channeling you gain immunity to lightning damage and a fly speed of 30 ft (no hover).
You become vulnerable to acid and fall damage while in this state. 
This effect lasts up to a number of rounds equal to your level, but can be dismissed at the end of your turn. 
All spent rounds are regained after a long rest.
This action sustains rage as if it were an attack.


Mirage Mantis

Your reflexes are bolstered by the surges of electricity flowing through your nerves, flashing brightly in your defense.
Your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity while raging. 
Hostile creatures that start their turn within your blindsight take 2d12 lightning damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.
