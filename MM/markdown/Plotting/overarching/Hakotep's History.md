[[Hakotep I]] was born on 6050 years ago

  

The church reconsecrated Wati in 2953, after 450 years of it being abandoned

  

Over 6,ooo years ago, in the declining years of Suthelia's First Age, [[Hakotep I|Pharaoh Hakotep]], known as the [[Hakotep I|The Sky Pharaoh]], ruled the nation of [[Suthelia]]. Before his death, Hakotep ordered the construction of a pyramid tomb incorporating technology stolen from the neighboring Shary civilization of the central [[Meht]]. Like the legendary flying cities of the Shary, Hakotep's tomb was capable of magical flight, and upon the pharaoh's death and burial, his pyramid took flight. It has remained in the skies above Heliope ever since, safe from tomb robbers and those would desecrate the pharaoh's final resting place.

Before Hakotep was buried, however, a sect of the church of [[Thanagolth]] known as the [[Sacrosanct Order of the Blue Feather]] stole two items from the dead pharaoh: his heart and his funerary mask, which contained two pieces of Hakotep's soul: his *ib*, the seat of emotion, thought, will, and intention, embodied in his heart; and his *ka*, or "vital spark," which the order trapped in the pharaoh's funerary mask. With Hakotep's *ib* and *ka* in their possession, the [[Sacrosanct Order of the Blue Feather|Order]] had hoped to commune with Hakotep's soul to learn the secrets of Shory magic and technology.

However, with the pieces of Hakotep's soul separated, bound in physical objects, and unable to rejoin together in the afterlife, the priests discovered they were unable to communicate with the deceased pharaoh. The two pieces of the Sky Pharaoh's soul did, however, empower the objects that contained them, creating two powerful magic items: the heart of Hakotep and the [[Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh]].

Hakotep's successor, [[Djederet II]], himself a priest of [[Thanagolth]], learned of the sect's activities when he took the throne. Scandalized by the desecration of his predecessor's tomb by the Sacrosanct Order, Djederet hid away Hakotep's heart and mask to keep the order's misdeeds secret and to keep the pieces of Hakotep's soul apart so he could not return from death to take his revenge on those who had violated his body and soul. Hakotep's heart was taken to [[Sothis]], while his death mask was hidden away in a temple to Thanagolth called the [[Sanctum of the Erudite Eye]] in the newly founded city of [[Wati]]. To prevent Hakotep's heart and mask from ever being found and reunited, [[Djederet II|Djederet]] purged all written records of these events, and as the centuries passed, knowledge of Hakotep, his reign, and the locations of these stolen relics have been mostly forgotten.

Over 4,000 years later, in 2499, the cult of [[Zuggtmoy]] unleashed a terrible disease called the Plague of Madness on the city of Wati. More than 60 percent of the city's population perished in the streets and in their homes, and Wati was virtually abandoned for over 450 years. In 2953 AR, the church of Faelloc returned to Wati and established a new temple in the city's ruins called the Grand Mausoleum.

Walling off much of the original city, the Faels transformed the abandoned settlement into an enormous necropolis, consecrating it in honor of the city's dead. Over the next 1700 years, people returned to rebuild a new city adjacent to the old one, and today the living city of Wati is more than three times the size of the old city.

Seven years ago, Pharaoh Khemet III, the Ruby Prince, formally opened Suthelia's ancient tombs and burial sites to foreign explorers. Khemet III understood that adventurers who've traveled great distances in search of treasure typically do not return from whence they came to sell their discoveries. Instead, they typically sell or trade what they do not keep as quickly as possible at the closest civilized community with an economy strong enough to absorb an influx of valuable antiquities. The Ruby Prince's policy has attracted not only explorers to the desert nation of Suthelia, but also countless scholars, private collectors, special interest groups such as the Pathfinder Society, and financial interests from all across the Inner Sea. A minor industry has sprung up just to support visiting explorers, and an even larger infrastructure has come into being to serve foreign investors and traders. Every opening of a major site has heralded an economic boom, for the local area and Suthelia as a whole.

Unlike many of Suthelia's tombs and graveyards, however, the necropolis of Wati has remained largely untouched, in no small part because of local taboos and the protection of the Grand Mausoleum's priests. But Khemet III has now ordered the local authorities and church of Faelloc to open Wati's necropolis to exploration for the purpose of discovery, study, and economic stimulus. Neither the pharaoh nor the church of Faelloc has any idea that the lost mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh lies hidden away in the necropolis, but a necromancer named Nebta-Khufre has learned of the artifact's existence, and has stolen it from the temple vault where it was housed.

But Nebta-Khufre is not the only newcomer to Wati with a secret interest in the Sanctum of the Erudite Eye. A band of adventurers called the Scorched Hand, all devout followers of Thanagolth, also seek the abandoned temple. Led by a foreign woman named Velriana Hypaxes, the Scorched Hand believes that the temple is theirs to explore by right, and they plan to keep the secrets (and treasures) of the temple out of the hands of nonbelievers such as the PCs.
