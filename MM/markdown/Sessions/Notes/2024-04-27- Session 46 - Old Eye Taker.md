## Notes

Tonight the party saved Anat Alsahra and the Imouthes twins from Judge "Old Eye Taker" Sotenre and his 7 bailiffs

They learnt that Anat was courting or being courted by one of the twins.
They learnt that there are undead who can controll undead and speak telepathically as well as that theree are undead who explode
 It also sort of reinforced the Ka pulses and the blindness theme
