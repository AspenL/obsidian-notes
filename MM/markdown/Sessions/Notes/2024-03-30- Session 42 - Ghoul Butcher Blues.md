## Notes

Tonight the party healed from last week, then fought a shop teeming with ghouls as a random encounter. They spent quite a bit of magic and lowered the Panic level to 15 at last.
They discovered evidence of a cult of Yeanoghu and Nyarlathotep in the abandoned butcher's shop as well as several half eaten dead commoners.
There was a tunnel under it that does lead into the necropolis.
