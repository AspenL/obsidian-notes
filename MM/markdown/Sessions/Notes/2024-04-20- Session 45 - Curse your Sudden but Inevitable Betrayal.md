## Notes

Tonight the party was put up to speed by the church of faelloc on their mission to get into the necropolis, they bought potions and scrolls and Anat identified the Abyssal Mushrooms which lead us in a whole tirade in the desert to study/make poison/destroy the mushrooms before the party was forced to murder each other for sustenance to their fungal overlords

Milo nearly killed Amon for destroying the shrooms, we talked about Milo's backstory and kicked him out of the party. Amon followed him and killed/watched zombies kill him in a back alley afterwards.
Milo will be back as a revenant.
