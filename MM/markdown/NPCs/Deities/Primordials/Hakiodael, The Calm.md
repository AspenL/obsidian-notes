Hakiodael is gender-fluid. She has something of a rivalry with [[Larand, The Quick]] who constantly tries to provoke him into racing, but nevertheless Hakiodael remains slow and steady.

He prefers lakes to rivers, and is said to cause sailors great distress as the sea around her becomes quiet and motionless, causing them to be stranded for as long as they remain near.
