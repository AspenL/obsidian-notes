Frugientoluth is extremely vain, he spends most of his time either admiring and accenting his appearance or constructing depictions of himself. He is extremely hurt by the notion that one might not find him attractive, or gods forbid, find someone else more attractive. 

If there is a bard on a group he will demand a performance be made in his honor and praise.
