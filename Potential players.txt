Player Rhynr#5583
Hello there. I like to go by Rhynr. I am 23 yrs old male from the US of A. I'm in the PST Timezone. I've been playing D&D5E for around 4-5 years now. My campaign I have been playing in for 3 years has ended and I'm wanting to get back into the game. It has been a few months since I've last played but I'm hoping to find a new group to play with. I bring to the table a cooperative mind set and wanting to push a story forward.

Interests: I like roleplay and a good narrative. Combat is a plus for me as well. I'm up for anything, lighthearted or serious.

Paid games?: No paid games.

Player Sixxy Nikki#2132

Name: Nick
Age: 21
Pronouns: he/him
System: DND 5E, UESRPG 3E
Availability: Open and very flexible availability
Languages: English only
Preferred style of game: I am definitely a best-of-both-worlds kind of player, as I enjoy the "videogamey" parts about TTRPG's such as leveling up, clearing dungeons, etc. But I also love to roleplay heavily, and exploration is a big part of my interests. I do prefer to play in a Homebrew setting of the DM's creation as I find the mystery to make it immersive.
Experience: 3 years as a DM and 1 year as a player of DND 5E. Just recently started playing the Elder Scrolls d100 RPG last year as well.
Platform: Foundry VTT
Pay to Play: No
About me: I am from Orlando, FL and am a huge fan of Fantasy RPGs and specifically worldbuilding in general. I can spend hours immersed in the lore of Elder Scrolls, GoT, or Exandria and believe it all to be real. The campaign I have always dreamed of playing in was one where I get to be amazed at the detail and uniqueness of a worlds lore, and to experience that magical feeling of uncovering it for the first time!

Hello there! I'm an avid roleplayer and storywriter with years of experience as both a Player and a DM, currently looking for a campaign that caters more towards roleplay. Can be a Living World or an Adventure Path/Homebrew setting, preferably for the long-term. I tend to function within the purview of Rules-as-Written, but do not mind 3PP or homebrew elements. Prefer to communicate via text (especially in the case of roleplay), but can voice chat if desired--so long as you don't ask me to imitate my Character's voice!.. years of experience and I still can't do voices well no matter how hard I try. Such is life, right?

Feel free to send a DM my way (Fenrir#9090) if you are interested! More than happy to talk details prior to making any decisions.

Platform(s): I have extensive experience with Discord, Roll20 and Foundry VTT, but prefer Foundry.
System(s): (experienced) Pathfinder 1e, (familiar) Starfinder, (new) Pathfinder 2e/D&D5e 
Interests: Any, though High Fantasy and Sci-fi are favorites!
Availability: Any time during Monday ~ Wednesday, or any time up to 8 PM EST Thursday ~ Sunday due to prior obligations.
Paid games?: No; I don't charge, so I prefer to not have to pay either

4 Players looking for a DM

Name(s): Jamie, John, David, and Summer (maybe Brian)
Preferred System:  DnD 5th Edition (DnD 5e) 
Availability: Monday or Tuesday, 8pm - 11/12 CT, bi-weekly
Paid Game: No.
Willing to DM sometimes or take over completely if we lose a DM? Absolutely
Game Type: Traditional high fantasy D&D. Good mix of combat, RP, and adventure. We are open to modules or homebrew but are definitely wanting to explore our characters in a collaborative story.
Notes: In looking for a game for the past few days, we have managed to assembled a group of four like-minded players (maybe 5) that are looking for a DM for an online 5e game to play every other week. We're looking for Monday or Tuesday starting around 8pm CT. We're a diverse group aged 28-47 (LGBTQ+, PoC friendly) and enjoy all aspects of the game, but mostly just want to play and have fun. We are open to modules or homebrew but we're looking for traditional D&D high fantasy and are really looking for a DM that wants to tell a collaborative story with us and our characters. Happy to use Discord for voice and (of course) the premier VTT, Foundry. If you're interested, want to learn more or meet us, let me (Jamie#6727) know!
