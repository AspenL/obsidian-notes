[[The Dreamcatcher]]

[[Head Priestess of [[Sin]]
           

The sisterhood is insatiable because they consume the fucked-up fruit, which gives them some kind of psychic powers, but makes them constantly hungry.

[[The Ambassador]] sends for the party, they have a job:

Their parent sent them abroad to study at a monastery (apparently being a bachelorette was not working for dad).

They managed to arrive early through some good luck with their transport.

They know the convent is throwing a party or a ceremonial ball of some kind in a day’s time.

Which is kind of wild because were not convents supposed to be chill and meditative?

So they’re curious and want to check it out to see if this could maybe not be a bad idea of a place to hang out at after all.

But they won’t go in themselves because if it is boring and the nuns catch them they’ll be forced to enroll earlier with no chance of dodging it.

So they want you to go as liaisons to the ball and scope it out, then meet them back at the town to dish the gossip.

Once you come back they promised to put in a good word with some local nobles for the party.

The problem lies in a few things:

a) The castle the convent is in, is in an island in the middle of the lake, which is only accessible by boat or ferry.

b) Visitors are expected to stay for the night as the lake’s fog is difficult to traverse at night between the rock reefs.

c) The nuns would very much not like anyone who eats the fruit of dreams to leave.

The Castle is the [[Bastion of the Black Rose]].

It is a well-respected temple of Sin, established by a nun in the early days of the county as a place for worship and educating new nuns in the traditions of their faith.

The community often seeks the nuns for guidance and healing.

The nuns are mostly Giants and Nicters, they all wear dark purple robes with black trim and light purple accents

The headmistress is [[Head Priestess of Sin|Sister Sórnsy]]
