The fruit of dreams tree is a plant abomination from the [[Void Between the Stars]].

During the day it appears as a regular fruit bearing tree among the others in the central garden of the castle, but at night the garden transforms.

Any creature that eats The Fruit of Dreams can see the transformation; others are unable to perceive it.

[

The sky has no stars, nor moon. All fire becomes black and lightless. Magical lights are purple and dim.

The ground is made of black cracked stone. The temple as well.

The trees are verdant and luxurious, but pale in comparison with the central one.

It stands with multicolored leaves and pure white branches. Its flowers are the size of watermelons and the fruits hanging from it are odorous and succulent, unblemished perfect specimens of the viewerâ€™s favorite fruit. One of them just within reach.

A soft warm and song can be heard in the halls.

A creature who eats the Fruit of Dreams becomes able to see into the [[Void Between the Stars| Void-Between]] as an action.

In addition they must make a WIS save DC 15 or be unable to gain sustenance from anything besides the fruit. They may attempt the save again after a short or long rest, ending the effect on two consecutive successes.

A creature who fails the save twice starts having nightmares with [[The Dreamcatcher]]  and becomes unable to finish a long rest.
