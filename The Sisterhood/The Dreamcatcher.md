This is a creature of scheming and deception, it will not kill if it can trick or manipulate.

It is a plant aberration from the [[Void Between the Stars]], it was struck out of the [[Feywild]] by the goddess [[Sin]] and into the void, where it spent hundreds of years slowly going mad and dying of cold. It was eventually summoned by a priestess in a botched ritual.

The priestess,[[Head Priestess of Sin]], believed she had summoned an angel of her mistress, due to the fact that it too had purple skin, and bore her mark in blazing light upon it's forehead


#### Description

It is a smooth purple humanoid, with long elven ears.

Its hair is a mane of petals framing its head and giving it volume.

It has no face, instead it bears a black hole filled with smoke that drifts when it talks.

Its forearms and forelegs are peppered with spikes as if a rosebush.

Its hands and feet are shackled with a golden length of twine.

The mark of [[Sin]] can be seen in blazing light above its head.

traits:
    - [Shape change, The Dreamcatcher can assume the form of any Medium or Large plant it has seen or return to its monstrous one as an action.]
	- [Fruit of Dreams., When in darkness, The Dreamcatcher can produce a fruit of its choice, which causes the following curse effects on a creature who consumes it: As an action the creature can shift their senses into the Void-Between or the Material plane. A creature who consumes the fruit twice must make a Wis Save DC 15 or become unable to gain nourishment from anything but the Fruit of Dreams. The creature can no longer complete long rests, being afflicted with alien nightmares sent to them by the Dreamcatcher. At the end of a short or long rest the creature may repeat the save through meditation, ending the effect on itself after two consecutive successes.]
actions:

    - [Induce Dream (Stun)., A creature within 60 ft. must make a WIS Save. On a failure, they are overcome with joy as the scene around them transforms into a fleeting glance of one of their greatest desires. A creature who is immune to being charmed makes the save with advantage. The creature remains charmed until it suffers damage or someone uses an action to shake them awake.]
    - [Every roseâ€™s thorn (Damage)., The ground in a line 30 ft long and 10 ft wide becomes difficult terrain. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DEX Save or take 3d8 piercing damage.]

reactions:
    - [Take root, As a reaction to being targeted by an attack (melee or ranged) the Dreamcatcher makes an attack roll against the triggering creature. It has a +6 to hit. On a hit the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage as roots attempt to drag them under the ground. The creature may choose to use their full movement to break free from the vines, otherwise it is grappled by the Dreamcatcher and must use their action on a subsequent turn if they wish to attempt it, another creature may use their action to free the targeted one if they so desire in which case the check is made with advantage.]
