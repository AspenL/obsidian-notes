Plot

The first day of the semester, first year at [[Kadic Academy]] for [[Garth Blackwell]]

He goes around and gets to be shown around by one of the gang
probably Odd or Stern

He is part of the sports track, so he obviously meets [[Yumi Ishiyama|Yumi]] there, [[Aelita Schaeffer|Aelita]] and [[Ulrich Stern|Stern]] share a philosophy class with him, she is interested in some epistemology and ethics in STEM and stern pretends he just needs the credits for his degree.

Honestly all of them could be on the Ethics class tbh

There is a kerfuffle and Aelita needs to be taken to the supercomputer, they are less than careful and Garth gets to follow these suspicious students


They try to pass it off but can't so they just kinda hope they can get an excuse to rewind time so he forgets
